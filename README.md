# Polity-Data-Pull


The following R script reads in Polity, PITF and Systemic Peace data from the Systemic Peace website (www.systemicpeace.org)
There are 33 series that need to be imported into IFs. The data is cleaned up to extract the needed variables to import into IFs, concorded with the IFs Country Concordance list and then exported to a file named: POLITY_FINAL.xlsx - which will be located in your working directory

IMPORTANT: Make sure you have the country concordance .csv (IFS_country_concorance_POLITY.csv) file in your working directory.
The link from the Sytemic Peace website may need to be updated before running code to get most recent version.
